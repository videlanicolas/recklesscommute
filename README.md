## A note on third party assets
This game uses assets from the asset store, these assets cannot be shared through the repo because of license issues. Unity prohibits re-distribution of assets even if those assets are free to download.
To address this issue and continue to allow contributions from external developers, we declare a third party directory where all downloaded assets live. This does not include assets made specifically to this game, which use the same license as the rest of the code. In order to contribute to the game you need to download/purchase the assets used in the game, otherwise the game won't run in your editor.

## Third party assets
* [Standard assets pack](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/essentials/asset-packs/standard-assets-for-unity-2017-3-32351).
* [POLYGON - Starter Pack](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/props/polygon-starter-pack-156819).

## Getting started
1. Clone this repo using git (for ease of use, you can use [Sourcetree](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/)).
2. Download/purchase the third party assets from the asset store, place them under `ThirdParty/` directory.
3. For this repo we use [git-flow](https://datasift.github.io/gitflow/IntroducingGitFlow.html), read about it if you are not familiar with it.
4. Submit your `pull-requests`, if approved it'll move to the release branch eventually.
